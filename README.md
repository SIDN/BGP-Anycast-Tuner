# The BGP Anycast Tuner

The BGP Tuner is a prototype graphical interface that presents the distribution of clients over the anycast sites using a pre-determined BGP configuration. We used <a href="https://ant.isi.edu/software/verfploeter/index.html"> Verfploeter</a> to carry out the measurements on Tangled, prepossessed them, and afterwards used them as the input for our interface.
